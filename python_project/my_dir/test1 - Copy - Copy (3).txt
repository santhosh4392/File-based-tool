management platform for wired and wireless
2. easy to monitor =[ network with feauture [AppRF and VisualRF]via]
3. manage [ aurba switch, providing CPU, memory and interface monitoring , config management,firmware update,..]
4. airwave impolement ZTP for =[ Aruba instand Aps(IAPs) , Aruba Switches, branch controllers]

Aruba mobility controllers

1.[A]support = [Global and Group Leavel configuration of M.controller]
2. several controller can working togather -->Aps provied -->[hierarichical, redundant M.controller system]
3. M.controller provied:
     1. Ap tunnel termination and transalational bridging 
     2. GRE tunnal between each Ap and Mobility controller
        -----------------------------------?
     3. Virutual connection point to wireless clients
        -----------------------------------?
     4. frame Translation  form 802.11 to 802.3 and  802.3 to 802.11 + encryption and decryption  of wifi traffic
     5. QOS of service Priorition 

     it will worke alone or clearPass, the mobility contorller Authenticate wireless client
     and include a stateful firewall that can be configured to filter wireless traffic

Mobility controller == Access Devices

Instant Access Points
---------------------

1. IAP is a system of access in layer2 subnet.
2. The IAPS are controlled by a single IAP that serves a dual role as both an [IAP and primary virtual controller]
3. this system can be deployed through a simplified setup process appropriate for smaller orginizations,
